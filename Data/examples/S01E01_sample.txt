When you find that one person
who connects you to the world,

you become someone different.

Someone better.

When that person is taken from you...

What do you become then?

Whatever he wanna do, you know?

What?

Where'd you get that,
in a cereal box?

You wanna see a real gun?

Forget you.

Every little punk
is carrying now, Anton.

That's why your father wanted us
to take the car home.

Relax.

We're picking up new hardware next week.
Restore a little order.

Besides, when we take the car,
we don't get to meet new friends.

Look at this guy.

You didn't bring enough
for the whole group.

I have to teach you about sharing.
